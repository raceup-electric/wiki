Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM is another well-known alternative. EKF-SLAM fuses motion and measurement updates recursively in a Bayesian framework, maintaining a joint Gaussian over vehicle pose and landmark positions. While computationally efficient for a small number of landmarks, its complexity scales quadratically with landmark count because the state covariance includes all cross-correlations. This scaling can become prohibitive in high-density environments or when many landmarks are tracked simultaneously, but is not an issue for Formula Student tracks that should not exceed a few hundred cones.

To explore alternatives, we tested the EKF-SLAM implementation from the [MRPT](https://mrpt.org/) library. The implementation is mature, industrial-grade, and optimized for speed. In practice, it performed comparably to, and in some cases better than, our graph-based SLAM in terms of global trajectory accuracy. Notably, cone association was significantly more robust: our implementation runs a simple nearest-neighbour algorithm, while MRTP leverages the variances of the distribution.

However, adopting the MRPT EKF-SLAM backend also has drawbacks. The codebase is external and not under direct control. Customization is limited; for example, per-landmark covariance adjustment is not easily supported without modifying library internals.
