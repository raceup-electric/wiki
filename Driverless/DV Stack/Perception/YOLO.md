We also tested a deep learning approach, aiming to complement classical clustering methods. The network we used was a lightweight encoder-decoder segmentation model, based on yolo11s-seg, with roughly 10 million trainable parameters. Its architecture allowed detection, segmentation, and classification of cones in a single forward pass, making it suitable for real-time deployment if accuracy were sufficient.

To handle our LiDAR data, we converted each scan into a three-channel image. The R channel contained the LiDAR signal intensity, the G channel the near-infrared image, and the B channel a depth map. This input structure allowed the network to exploit spatial and distance information simultaneously. For images from external datasets like FSOCO, we used the Depth Anything v2 model to generate depth maps, ensuring a consistent three-channel input where the R and G channels were grayscale camera images and the B channel carried the predicted depth.

Training was done in two stages. First, we fine-tuned the network on the FSOCO dataset with depth augmentation to transfer general cone detection knowledge. Then, we performed a second fine-tuning step on our smaller in-house LiDAR dataset to specialize the network to our sensor characteristics and track conditions. This two-step process helped the network adapt from standard camera images to LiDAR-derived images.

Despite these efforts, test results showed only moderate performance. Using both datasets improved metrics slightly, but the model still struggled with small or partially occluded cones, and overall segmentation and classification accuracy remained low. The network could detect larger cones reasonably well, but recall and precision for the full range of track landmarks were insufficient for reliable on-car use.

In the end, deep learning perception was considerably worse than classical clustering methods in our pipeline. While it demonstrated the potential of using depth-augmented images and multi-channel LiDAR inputs, the team continued to rely on clustering for real-time cone detection, as it remained far more robust and consistent under real driving conditions.
