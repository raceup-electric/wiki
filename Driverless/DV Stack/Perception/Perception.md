LiDAR is a remote-sensing sensor that produces dense 3D point clouds by measuring the time-of-flight of laser pulses. It gives precise range and angular information for every return. We use the Ouster OS1.

RANSAC is a robust model-fitting algorithm that finds a consensus model in data contaminated with outliers. It repeatedly samples minimal subsets, fits a model, and counts inliers within a distance threshold. The model with the largest inlier set is selected as the best fit.
To filter ground with RANSAC we fit a planar model to the lowermost points or to the whole cloud, tune the distance threshold and iteration count, then classify inliers as ground and remove them. This removes road surface points while preserving above-ground objects. RANSAC is efficient here because ground is well approximated by a plane and inlier testing is cheap.
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering method that groups points based on neighborhood density. It finds clusters of arbitrary shape and marks sparse points as noise. After RANSAC ground removal, DBSCAN can cluster remaining points into individual obstacles such as cones. Clusters that match expected size and height are labeled as cones.
